[ Starting a game with bots ]

1. Launch Counter-Strike 1.6.

2. In the bottom left, click on "New Game".

3. In the window that appears, ensure the "Include CPU Players..." option of the "Server" tab is selected.

For Steps 4-6, you may wish to configure each tab's settings to match the "Recommended Game Settings" .png / image file in the "Documentation" folder of this archive.
Settings highlighted in red have been changed from their default values.
The default basic game settings have many timings that are too long or uncompetitive, giving the game a casual feel.
The settings correct this to match Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's basic game settings.
The rest of Counter-Strike 1.6's default basic limitations (e.g., maximum players) are removed automatically by this guide.
Usage of the recommended game settings is entirely optional and is not required for the use of this guide.

4. Configure this tab's options to your preference.

5. Click on the "Game" tab and configure this tab's options to your preference.

6. Click on the "CPU Player Options" tab and configure this tab's options to your preference.

7. Click "Start" to load the game.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[ Customising & controlling bots ]

Once you have started a game with bots, you can customise and control their behaviour by using the bot commands in-game via an easy-to-use graphical command menu or by manually entering commands into the game console.

A full list & explanation of all available bot commands & usage instructions (beginner-friendly) is available in text and colour format (with a clickable list of contents) in the "Documentation" folder of this archive. Be sure to read this if you are unsure of the existence or effect of any command.

The "ReGameDLL_CS" modification used by this guide to enable bots also adds multiple useful game configuration commands you may wish to utilise. These do not alter base game functionality by default and are listed & explained here: https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS#commands

[ Frequently Asked Questions ]

Q: Which platforms are supported?
A: Only Windows & Linux are supported - macOS cannot be supported as ReGameDLL_CS is incompatible with it (this is out of my control).

Q: Does this require Counter-Strike: Condition Zero to be installed? Why do I have to copy a "czero" folder during installation?
A: This is simply a minor fix for a Counter-Strike: Condition Zero issue caused by installing the Counter-Strike 1.6 bot menu.
A: You do not need to own or have Counter-Strike: Condition Zero installed to use this guide.

Q: Does this require Half-Life to be installed? Why do I have to copy a "valve" folder during installation?
A: This is simply the bot menu enabler, but for Linux - due to an oversight by Valve, it is necessary to implement it in this way.
A: Don't worry, this won't affect Half-Life or any other game mods in any way.
A: You do not need to own or have Half-Life installed to use this guide.

Q: Which versions of Counter-Strike 1.6 is this guide compatible with?
A: Only the latest official Steam version (not Warzone or any other older or unofficial distributions)

Q: Will this modification get me VAC Banned?
A: No.

Q: Will this modification prevent me from playing on online servers?
A: No.

Q: Does this modification change or break the base game functionality in any way?
A: No. Occasionally, some minor unintended bugs or differences may arise, but these are extremely minor and do not affect gameplay.
A: These are fixed quickly as there is an active issue tracker for ReGameDLL_CS at https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS/issues.

Q: Do I need any third-party programs to use this?
A: No.

Q: Can I use this guide with my Counter-Strike 1.6 Steam server?
A: This guide only supports clients (normal Steam installations used to join servers), not servers, so I cannot guarantee that it'll work out of the box.
A: ReGameDLL_CS itself, however, is fully compatible with Counter-Strike 1.6 Steam servers. You can set it up yourself from the GitHub repository:
A: https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS/releases
A: Servers are a completely different aspect with other factors and possible user setups that need to be addressed by a guide like this.
A: Hence, a separate variant of this guide aimed at servers written from scratch would be required.

Q: Is this guide compatible with Metamod and / or AMX Mod X?
A: No. ReGameDLL_CS itself, however, is compatible with it on Counter-Strike 1.6 Windows & Linux dedicated servers, but you will need to set it up yourself.
A: Make sure you are using the latest Metamod-P from https://github.com/Bots-United/metamod-p/releases if you try it - not normal Metamod as that is incompatible.
A: If you wish to use AMX Mod X, make sure you use the "AMX Mod X Base" option from https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads.php as the installer causes some issues.
A: This guide does not cover Metamod or AMX Mod X installations as this guide targets clients (listen servers) only, which are not supported by Metamod or AMX Mod X.
A: Although the game may work fine with them installed, it can break with any official Counter-Strike 1.6 Steam update, and the developers would have no reason to fix this.

Q: Why should I use this modification over my already working ZBot / CSBot / another / previous version of this bot enabler?
A: They are outdated and have developed several game-breaking issues over the years - this modification has no issues, is more stable and is open-source.

Q: I already have ZBot / CSBot / another / previous version of this bot enabler installed. How should I install this modification?
A: Simply follow the instructions of the "Installation" section above as normal. It will work perfectly.

Q: Why are there copies of all documentation in the "Half-Life\cstrike" folder?
A: For archival purposes - often, users install this modification then delete the downloaded archive, which would leave them without documentation.

<<< Trivia >>>

The authors of Counter-Strike: Condition-Zero included a bot system & bot menu with the game.
They are present in Counter-Strike 1.6's game code but are disabled by default. Required files & bot menu resource files are not included.
"ReGameDLL_CS" by s1lentq is an open-source rewrite of Counter-Strike 1.6's game code (retains all base game functionality & default behaviour) with the bot system enabled, many new optional features and better stability and support for third-party server plugins. This guide is based off this modification.
